We provide test results for various languages based on the request of Google Translate and the inference module of Hugging Face. While it is best to train and infer LLM models in their original languages, researchers can test the performance of the continuously updated LLM model in specific languages. Therefore, this package is intended for performance testing of publicly available English LLM models rather than for service purposes.
